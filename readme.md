### Collage Builder
A simple app built in a complex way possible.
Can be done in any tech stack but the infra if written in typescript then it would be ease as the aws cdk is itself coded in typescript

### MOTO
To learn aws cdk and building things in complex way as gpt wrote the collage building code
But the whole design is mine

### Requirements
1. Localstack (I just love this) -> No aws , ho ho ho
2. Node
3. AWS account for caching as localstack don't support in free plan
